      <p>
        Title says is all really. I'm a uk web developer that regularly creates
        web-related stuff and this site showcases some of the stuff Ive done and
        should give a decent understanding of my skill-set.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current learning surrounds the fundamental web technologies (HTML,
        CSS , and Javascript), as well as the frontend web framework: React,
        which this site was built with.
